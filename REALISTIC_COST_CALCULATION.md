# VoiceLink - Realistic Cost Calculation

## ðŸ“Š Real-World Speaking Patterns

**1 hour call between 2 people**

### What Actually Happens:
- Total call time: 60 minutes
- **Actual speaking time: 40 minutes** (not 60)
  - User A speaks: 20 minutes
  - User B speaks: 20 minutes
- Silence/pauses: 20 minutes
  - Listening while other person talks
  - Thinking pauses
  - Natural conversation breaks
  - Connection delays

**Speaking efficiency: 67% of total time**

## ðŸ§® Calculate Realistic Characters

### Speaking Rate:
- 150 words per minute (average conversational speed)
- 5 characters per word (average English word)

### Character Calculation:

```
User A speaks 20 minutes:
20 minutes Ã— 150 words/min = 3,000 words
3,000 words Ã— 5 characters = 15,000 characters

User B speaks 20 minutes:
20 minutes Ã— 150 words/min = 3,000 words  
3,000 words Ã— 5 characters = 15,000 characters

TOTAL REALISTIC CHARACTERS = 30,000 per hour
```

## ðŸ’° Azure Costs (Per Hour)

### Speech-to-Text
```
Price: $1.00 per audio hour

Only 40 minutes of actual speech processed:
40 minutes = 0.67 hours
0.67 hours Ã— $1.00 = $0.67
```

### Translation
```
Price: $0.01 per 1,000 characters

30,000 characters to translate:
30,000 Ã· 1,000 = 30
30 Ã— $0.01 = $0.30
```

### TTS - Neural Voices
```
Price: $0.016 per 1,000 characters

30,000 characters to synthesize:
30,000 Ã· 1,000 = 30
30 Ã— $0.016 = $0.48
```

**AZURE TOTAL: $0.67 + $0.30 + $0.48 = $1.45 per hour**

---

## ðŸ’° Amazon Polly Costs (Per Hour)

### TTS - Standard Voices
```
Price: $0.004 per 1,000 characters

30,000 characters to synthesize:
30,000 Ã· 1,000 = 30
30 Ã— $0.004 = $0.12
```

**HYBRID TOTAL: $0.67 + $0.30 + $0.12 = $1.09 per hour**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ With Smart Optimizations

### Phrase Caching (15% reduction)

Common phrases that get cached:
- "Hello" â†’ "Hola"
- "Thank you" â†’ "Gracias"  
- "Yes" â†’ "SÃ­"
- "No" â†’ "No"
- "Goodbye" â†’ "AdiÃ³s"

**Effect:**
- 15% of characters don't need translation/TTS
- Actual characters processed: 30,000 Ã— 0.85 = 25,500

```
Translation with cache:
25,500 Ã· 1,000 = 25.5
25.5 Ã— $0.01 = $0.26

TTS (Polly Standard) with cache:
25,500 Ã· 1,000 = 25.5
25.5 Ã— $0.004 = $0.10
```

**OPTIMIZED TOTAL: $0.67 + $0.26 + $0.10 = $1.03 per hour**

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Calculator

**To calculate cost for your usage:**

```
1. Count actual speaking minutes: _____ min

2. Characters = Speaking_minutes Ã— 750
   Characters = _____ characters

3. STT = (Speaking_minutes Ã· 60) Ã— $1.00 = $_____

4. Translation = (Characters Ã— 0.85 Ã· 1,000) Ã— $0.01 = $_____

5. TTS = (Characters Ã— 0.85 Ã· 1,000) Ã— $0.004 = $_____

TOTAL = $_____
```

**Example for 30 minutes speaking:**
```
Characters = 30 Ã— 750 = 22,500
STT = (30 Ã· 60) Ã— $1.00 = $0.50
Translation = (22,500 Ã— 0.85 Ã· 1,000) Ã— $0.01 = $0.19
TTS = (22,500 Ã— 0.85 Ã· 1,000) Ã— $0.004 = $0.08

TOTAL = $0.77 per 60-minute session
```
