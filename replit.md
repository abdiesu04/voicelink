# VoiceLink - Real-Time Voice Translation App

## Overview
VoiceLink is a real-time voice translation application that enables two users to have conversations in different languages with instant translation. Built with Azure Speech and Translation services, it provides low-latency, high-quality voice translation using WebSocket connections.

## Purpose
Break language barriers by allowing users to speak naturally in their preferred language while their conversation partner hears real-time translations in theirs.

### Task 5: Male/Female Voice Selection (Complete)
Implemented user-selectable voice gender preference for Text-to-Speech output:

**Features:**
- **VoiceGenderSelector Component**: Radio button UI with visual distinction (User/UserRound icons)
- **Room Creation**: Users select their voice gender preference during room setup
- **Room Joining**: Participants select their voice gender when joining
- **State Propagation**: Voice gender stored in room data and passed via WebSocket
- **Azure TTS Integration**: Maps language + gender to specific Azure Neural voices

**Implementation Details:**
- Updated schema to include `voiceGender` ("male" | "female") for both creator and participant
- Extended Room interface with `creatorVoiceGender` and `participantVoiceGender` fields
- Created `getAzureVoiceName()` helper with 15 languages × 2 genders (30 voices)
- Modified `speakText()` to accept gender parameter and set `speechSynthesisVoiceName`
- Enhanced WebSocket flow to exchange voice preferences between users
- Fixed late-joiner scenario: Participant receives creator's voice gender on join

**Supported Azure Neural Voices:**
- English: GuyNeural (male), JennyNeural (female)
- Spanish: AlvaroNeural (male), ElviraNeural (female)
- French: HenriNeural (male), DeniseNeural (female)
- German: ConradNeural (male), KatjaNeural (female)
- Italian: DiegoNeural (male), ElsaNeural (female)
- Portuguese: DuarteNeural (male), RaquelNeural (female)
- Russian: DmitryNeural (male), SvetlanaNeural (female)
- Japanese: KeitaNeural (male), NanamiNeural (female)
- Korean: InJoonNeural (male), SunHiNeural (female)
- Chinese: YunxiNeural (male), XiaoxiaoNeural (female)
- Arabic: HamedNeural (male), ZariyahNeural (female)
- Hindi: MadhurNeural (male), SwaraNeural (female)
- Dutch: MaartenNeural (male), ColetteNeural (female)
- Polish: MarekNeural (male), ZofiaNeural (female)
- Turkish: AhmetNeural (male), EmelNeural (female)

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Clean, accessible voice selection UI on create/join pages
- ✅ Voice preference visible in form before room creation
- ✅ Partner's voice gender automatically detected and used for TTS
- ✅ Natural-sounding, gender-appropriate voices for all languages
- ✅ Consistent voice experience throughout conversation

**Architect Review**: Passed - Voice flow propagates correctly, late-joiner edge case handled, all languages covered with valid Azure voice names.

### Task 4: Hybrid Real-Time Transcription Implementation (Complete)
Implemented a hybrid approach that provides instant visual feedback while maintaining translation quality:

**Architecture:**
- **Interim Results**: Azure Speech SDK `recognizing` events capture partial transcriptions every 300ms
- **Final Results**: Azure Speech SDK `recognized` events trigger translation and TTS
- **Cost Optimization**: Interim transcriptions bypass translation API to reduce costs
- **Visual Distinction**: Interim text shown with dashed border, italic style, and "Transcribing..." indicator

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `interim` boolean flag to transcription message schema
- Throttled interim updates in Room.tsx using `lastInterimSentRef` (300ms intervals)
- Server broadcasts interim transcriptions directly without translation
- State management clears interim text when final translation arrives
- TranscriptionPanel displays interim with animated pulse indicator

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Users see immediate visual feedback while speaking
- ✅ Translation quality remains high (complete sentences only)
- ✅ TTS playback stays smooth (no choppy corrections)
- ✅ Reduced API costs (fewer translation calls)
- ✅ Better perceived latency for long continuous speech

**Architect Review**: Passed - Implementation follows hybrid approach correctly, throttling is efficient, no race conditions observed.

### Real-Time Transcription Flow
1. User speaks → Azure Speech SDK `recognizing` event fires (~100ms)
2. Client throttles updates to 300ms intervals
3. Interim text sent via WebSocket with `interim: true` flag
4. Server broadcasts interim directly to both users (no translation)
5. UI displays interim with dashed border and "Transcribing..." indicator
6. User pauses → Azure Speech SDK `recognized` event fires
7. Final text sent via WebSocket with `interim: false` flag
8. Server translates text using Azure Translator API
9. Server broadcasts translation to both users
10. Client plays TTS audio using partner's selected voice gender
11. Final message added to conversation history

### Voice Selection Flow
1. User creates/joins room → Selects language and voice gender (male/female)
2. Voice preference stored in room data (creator/participant)
3. User navigates to room with voiceGender in URL params
4. WebSocket join message includes voiceGender
5. When participant joins, both users exchange voice preferences via WebSocket
6. Room.tsx stores partner's voice gender in state
7. During translation, TTS uses partner's language + voice gender
8. Azure Speech SDK synthesizes speech with appropriate Neural voice

## User Preferences
