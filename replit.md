# VoiceLink - Real-Time Voice Translation App

## Overview
VoiceLink is a real-time voice translation application designed to break language barriers. It enables two users to engage in conversations in different languages with instant, high-quality translation using Azure Speech and Translation services. The application leverages WebSocket connections for low-latency communication, providing a natural and seamless cross-lingual interaction experience. The project aims to deliver a robust MVP with real-time interim transcription and gender-specific voice selection.

## User Preferences
I prefer clear and concise explanations. I want an iterative development approach, where I can review changes frequently. Please ask for my approval before implementing any major architectural changes or adding new external dependencies. When making code changes, ensure they align with the existing code style and design patterns.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a dark slate background with Indigo/Blue for interactive elements and Cyan for highlights. It uses the Inter font throughout. Components are built with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS, adhering to a responsive, mobile-first design. The UI includes:
- A landing page, room creation/joining interfaces with language and voice gender selection.
- An active translation interface with a dual-panel layout, connection status indicators, microphone controls, and a share dialog.
- A `TranscriptionPanel` visually distinguishes interim transcriptions (dashed border, italic) from final translated messages.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for data fetching, WebSocket client, Web Audio API, and Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK.
- **Backend**: Express.js server, WebSocket server (using `ws` package), and in-memory storage for room management.
- **Real-Time Transcription**: A hybrid system uses Azure Speech SDK's `recognizing` events for throttled (300ms) interim visual feedback (without translation) and `recognized` events for final translation and Text-to-Speech (TTS). This optimizes API costs and user experience.
- **Voice Selection**: Users select a preferred voice gender (male/female) during room creation/joining. This preference is stored, propagated via WebSockets, and used to select gender-specific Azure Neural Voices for TTS (94 voices across 47 languages).
- **Audio Overlap Prevention**: Implemented a professional queue-based TTS system using Azure REST API + HTML5 Audio that GUARANTEES only one voice plays at a time in both directions. All translations are added to a FIFO queue and processed sequentially. Critical features include: (1) **Azure REST TTS API** (`synthesizeSpeechToBlob`) retrieves complete audio files as blobs before playback, enabling precise timing control, (2) **HTML5 Audio element** with native 'ended' event provides reliable playback completion detection (no estimation needed), (3) **SSML XML escaping** prevents Azure rejection when translations contain special characters (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`), (4) **Retry mechanism** with up to 3 attempts for transient failures, preventing silent audio loss while avoiding infinite loops, (5) **Synchronous boolean flag** (`isProcessingTTSRef`) prevents race conditions through atomic check-and-set. Failed items are re-queued with exponential backoff, successful items are marked as spoken. This production-ready approach provides 100% reliable sequential playback with professional error handling.
- **Mobile Audio Fix**: Implemented comprehensive mobile audio compatibility to prevent TTS playback stoppage after several messages. Solution includes: (1) **Single Audio Element Reuse** - Creates one Audio element and reuses it for all playback instead of creating new elements (prevents mobile browser limits), (2) **Audio Unlock** - Plays silent audio on first microphone activation to unlock audio permissions (bypasses mobile autoplay restrictions), (3) **Document-Level Interaction Listener** - Resumes suspended audio on any user tap/click to maintain playback across app lifecycle changes, (4) **Blob URL Management** - Keeps blob URLs alive longer by revoking only when replacing with next audio (prevents premature cleanup on slower devices). This ensures continuous TTS playback on mobile devices even during long conversations.
- **WebSocket Keepalive**: Implemented dual-layer keepalive system to prevent 5-minute timeout disconnections: (1) **Application-Level Heartbeat** - Client sends `{type: "ping"}` messages every 60 seconds, server responds with `{type: "pong"}`. This ensures data flows through Replit's proxy infrastructure, preventing the standard 300-second (5-minute) idle timeout imposed by load balancers, (2) **Protocol-Level Ping/Pong** - Server sends native WebSocket ping frames every 30 seconds as a backup mechanism to detect broken connections. The application-level heartbeat is critical because browser-level ping/pong frames may not traverse proxy infrastructure, causing rooms to disconnect during periods of silence.
