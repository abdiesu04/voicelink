# Voice Translation App - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach**: Design System-Based with Communication Tool Inspiration

Drawing from modern communication platforms like Discord, Zoom, and Linear, this design prioritizes clarity, real-time feedback, and minimal cognitive load during active conversations. The interface must feel professional yet approachable, with instant visual feedback for all translation states.

**Core Principles**:
- Immediate clarity: Users should instantly understand connection state and active speaker
- Focused communication: Minimize visual noise during active translation
- Trust and reliability: Professional design that instills confidence in real-time translation
- Accessibility: Clear visual and auditory feedback for all states

## Typography System

**Font Family**:

- Secondary: System font stack for real-time transcription displays (performance)

**Hierarchy**:

- Page Titles: text-3xl, font-semibold
- Section Headers: text-xl, font-semibold
- Body Text: text-base, font-normal
- UI Labels: text-sm, font-medium
- Real-time Transcription: text-lg, font-normal (high readability)
- Status Indicators: text-xs to text-sm, font-medium, uppercase tracking-wide

## Layout System

**Spacing Primitives**: Use Tailwind units of **2, 4, 8, 12, 16** for consistent rhythm
- Component padding: p-4, p-8
- Section spacing: space-y-8, space-y-12
- Element margins: m-2, m-4
- Grid gaps: gap-4, gap-8

**Container Strategy**:
- Landing page: max-w-7xl mx-auto
- App interface: Full viewport with sidebar (if needed) or centered max-w-5xl
- Room interface: Full-screen experience with minimal chrome
- Form containers: max-w-md for focused input
