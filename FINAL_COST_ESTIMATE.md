# VoiceLink - Final Cost Estimate (30K Characters/Hour)

## üìä Base Scenario

**Realistic 1-hour conversation:**
- 30,000 characters generated per hour
- 40 minutes of actual speaking
- 20 minutes of silence/pauses

---

## üí∞ WITHOUT Optimization Techniques

### Azure Pricing

**Speech-to-Text:**
```
40 minutes of audio = 0.67 hours
0.67 √ó $1.00/hour = $0.67
```

**Translation:**
```
30,000 characters √∑ 1,000 = 30
30 √ó $0.01 = $0.30
```

**TTS (Azure Neural):**
```
30,000 characters √∑ 1,000 = 30
30 √ó $0.016 = $0.48
```

**TOTAL WITHOUT OPTIMIZATION: $1.45/hour**

---

### Amazon Polly Standard (Instead of Azure TTS)

**TTS (Polly Standard):**
```
30,000 characters √∑ 1,000 = 30
30 √ó $0.004 = $0.12
```

**TOTAL WITH POLLY: $1.09/hour**
**Savings: $0.36/hour (25% reduction)**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è WITH Optimization Techniques

### Technique 1: Phrase Caching (15% reduction)

**What it does:**
- Cache common translations: "Hello"‚Üí"Hola", "Thank you"‚Üí"Gracias"
- Avoid re-translating same phrases
- Avoid re-synthesizing same audio

**Impact on 30,000 characters:**
```
Characters cached: 30,000 √ó 0.15 = 4,500
Characters processed: 30,000 - 4,500 = 25,500
```

**New costs:**
```
Translation: 25,500 √∑ 1,000 √ó $0.01 = $0.26 (saved $0.04)
TTS: 25,500 √∑ 1,000 √ó $0.004 = $0.10 (saved $0.02)
```

### Technique 2: Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

**What it does:**
- Stop processing when no one is speaking
- Detect silence automatically
- Resume when speech detected

**Already applied in base scenario:**
```
Only 40 minutes processed (not 60)
STT cost already optimized: $0.67
```

### Technique 3: Silence Suppression

**What it does:**
- Don't send silent audio to Azure
- Additional 5-10% reduction in STT time

**Impact:**
```
Current: 40 minutes = 0.67 hours
With suppression: 38 minutes = 0.63 hours
0.63 √ó $1.00 = $0.63
Savings: $0.04
```

| Service | Characters | Price/1K | Cost |
|---------|-----------|----------|------|
| **STT (with silence suppression)** | 38 min audio | $1.00/hour | **$0.63** |
| **Translation (with caching)** | 25,500 | $0.01 | **$0.26** |
| **TTS (Polly Std + caching)** | 25,500 | $0.004 | **$0.10** |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$0.99** |

```

### After Technique 1 (Switch to Polly Standard):
```
$1.45 - $0.36 = $1.09/hour

## ‚úÖ FINAL ESTIMATE

### Based on 30,000 characters per hour with all optimization techniques:

**Cost per hour (2 users): $0.99**

**Rounded: ~$1.00 per hour**

**Cost per user per hour: $0.50**

**Cost per minute: $0.02** (2 cents)

## üìã Character-to-Cost Formula

**For any character count:**

```
STT = (Speaking_minutes √∑ 60) √ó $1.00 √ó 0.95
Translation = (Characters √ó 0.85 √∑ 1,000) √ó $0.01
TTS = (Characters √ó 0.85 √∑ 1,000) √ó $0.004

Example with 30,000 characters:
STT = (40 √∑ 60) √ó $1.00 √ó 0.95 = $0.63
Translation = (30,000 √ó 0.85 √∑ 1,000) √ó $0.01 = $0.26
TTS = (30,000 √ó 0.85 √∑ 1,000) √ó $0.004 = $0.10
TOTAL = $0.99
```

---

## üéØ Cost per 1,000 Characters

```
30,000 characters costs $0.99
1,000 characters costs: $0.99 √∑ 30 = $0.033

Per character: $0.000033
```

## üí∞ Monthly Budget Examples

### Light Usage (10 hours/month):
```
10 √ó $0.99 = $9.90/month
```

### Medium Usage (50 hours/month):
```
50 √ó $0.99 = $49.50/month
```

### Heavy Usage (100 hours/month):
```
