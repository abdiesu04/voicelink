## 1. Service Architecture

### Current Technology Stack

**VoiceLink uses a three-stage pipeline for real-time translation:**

```
User A (English) ──> [1] Speech-to-Text ──> "Hello, how are you?"
                              ↓
                     [2] Translation ──> "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
                              ↓
                     [3] Text-to-Speech ──> 🔊 Audio Output
                              ↓

## 3. Worst-Case Scenario Analysis

### 3.1 Scenario Definition

**Assumptions for Maximum Cost:**
- 2 users in a translation room
- 60 minutes of continuous conversation
- Each user speaks 50% of the time (30 minutes each)
- Average speaking rate: 150 words/minute
- Average word length: 5 characters/word
- Zero silence or pauses (unrealistic but worst-case)

### 3.2 Character Volume Calculations

```
Speaking Rate Calculation:
├─ Words per minute: 150
├─ Characters per word: 5
└─ Characters per minute: 750

Per User (30 minutes speaking):
├─ User A: 30 min × 750 chars/min = 22,500 characters
├─ User B: 30 min × 750 chars/min = 22,500 characters
└─ TOTAL: 45,000 characters per hour
```

### 3.3 Worst-Case Cost Breakdown

#### Option A: Azure Complete Stack (Current)

| Service | Calculation | Cost |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Speech-to-Text** | 1.0 hours × $1.00/hour | $1.00 |
| **Translation** | 45,000 chars ÷ 1,000 × $0.01 | $0.45 |
| **TTS (Azure Neural)** | 45,000 chars ÷ 1,000 × $0.016 | $0.72 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$2.17/hour** |

#### Option B: Azure + Amazon Polly Standard (Hybrid)

| Service | Calculation | Cost |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Speech-to-Text** | 1.0 hours × $1.00/hour | $1.00 |
| **Translation** | 45,000 chars ÷ 1,000 × $0.01 | $0.45 |
| **TTS (Polly Standard)** | 45,000 chars ÷ 1,000 × $0.004 | $0.18 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$1.63/hour** |

**Savings:** $0.54/hour (25% reduction)

---

## 4. Cost Optimization Techniques

### 4.1 Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

**Purpose:** Stop processing audio during silence and pauses

**Implementation:**
- Monitor audio input for voice activity
- Pause STT recognition during silence
- Resume when speech detected

**Impact:**
- Reduces STT processing time by 30-35%
- **Savings:** $0.30-$0.35/hour on STT costs

**Technical Approach:**
```javascript
// Pseudo-code
if (audioLevel < SILENCE_THRESHOLD) {
  pauseRecognition();
} else {
  resumeRecognition();
}
```

### 4.2 Phrase Caching

**Purpose:** Avoid re-translating and re-synthesizing common phrases

**Implementation:**
- Build cache of frequently used phrases
- Store translation pairs (e.g., "Hello" → "Hola")
- Store pre-synthesized audio for common phrases

**Cache Hit Rate:** 15% (conservative estimate)

**Impact:**
- Reduces Translation API calls by 15%
- Reduces TTS synthesis by 15%
- **Savings:** ~$0.06/hour combined

**Example Cache Entries:**
```
"Hello" → "Hola" (+ pre-synthesized audio)
"Thank you" → "Gracias" (+ pre-synthesized audio)
"Goodbye" → "Adiós" (+ pre-synthesized audio)
"Yes" → "Sí" (+ pre-synthesized audio)
"No" → "No" (+ pre-synthesized audio)
```

### 4.3 Natural Conversation Patterns

**Observation:** Real conversations include natural pauses

**Realistic Speaking Time:**
- Total call: 60 minutes
- Actual speaking: ~40 minutes (67%)
- Pauses/listening: ~20 minutes (33%)

**Impact:**
- Automatically reduces all service usage by 33%
- No implementation needed (natural user behavior)

### 4.4 Filler Word Removal

**Purpose:** Remove non-essential words before translation

**Implementation:**
- Strip filler words: "um", "uh", "like", "you know"
- Reduces character count by ~5%

**Impact:**
- **Savings:** ~$0.02/hour on translation + TTS

### 4.5 Amazon Polly Standard Voices

**Purpose:** Use more economical TTS without Azure change

**Trade-off:**
- **Cost:** 75% cheaper ($4 vs $16 per 1M chars)
- **Quality:** Slightly less natural than Neural voices
- **Clarity:** Still highly intelligible and clear

**Impact:**
- **Savings:** $0.54/hour compared to Azure Neural
- **Implementation:** 2 hours of development time

---

## 5. Average-Case Analysis

### 5.1 Realistic Scenario

**Adjusted Assumptions:**
- 60-minute call duration
- 40 minutes of actual speaking (67% of time)
- 20 minutes of natural pauses/silence
- 15% phrase cache hit rate
- Amazon Polly Standard voices
- Voice Activity Detection enabled

### 5.2 Optimized Character Volume

```
Actual Speaking Time: 40 minutes (vs 60 worst-case)
Characters Generated: 30,000 (vs 45,000 worst-case)

Breakdown:
├─ User A speaks: 20 min × 750 chars/min = 15,000 chars
├─ User B speaks: 20 min × 750 chars/min = 15,000 chars
└─ Cache hit (15%): -4,500 chars = 25,500 chars actually processed
```

### 5.3 Average-Case Cost Calculation

| Service | Worst-Case | Optimization | Optimized Cost |
|---------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **STT** | $1.00 | VAD (33% reduction) | **$0.67** |
| **Translation** | $0.45 | Natural patterns + Cache (43% reduction) | **$0.26** |
| **TTS (Polly Std)** | $0.18 | Natural patterns + Cache (44% reduction) | **$0.10** |
| **TOTAL** | $1.63 | Combined optimizations | **$1.03** |

### 5.4 Detailed Calculations

**Speech-to-Text (Optimized):**
```
Audio processed = 40 minutes = 0.67 hours
Cost = 0.67 × $1.00 = $0.67
Savings: $0.33 (33% reduction from worst-case)
```

**Translation (Optimized):**
```
Characters to translate = 25,500 (after caching)
Cost = (25,500 ÷ 1,000) × $0.01 = $0.26
Savings: $0.19 (42% reduction from worst-case)
```

**Text-to-Speech (Optimized):**
```
Characters to synthesize = 25,500
Using Polly Standard: (25,500 ÷ 1,000) × $0.004 = $0.10
Savings: $0.62 vs Azure Neural (86% reduction)
Savings: $0.08 vs Polly worst-case (44% reduction)
```

## Appendix B: Calculation Formulas

### Speaking Rate to Characters

```
Characters = Minutes × Words_per_Minute × Chars_per_Word

Example:
30 min × 150 words/min × 5 chars/word = 22,500 characters
```

### Service Costs

```
STT_Cost = Audio_Hours × $1.00

Translation_Cost = (Characters ÷ 1,000) × $0.01

TTS_Cost_Azure = (Characters ÷ 1,000) × $0.016
TTS_Cost_Polly_Neural = (Characters ÷ 1,000) × $0.016
TTS_Cost_Polly_Standard = (Characters ÷ 1,000) × $0.004
```

### Optimization Impact

```
Optimized_STT = Base_STT × (1 - VAD_Reduction)
              = $1.00 × (1 - 0.33)
              = $0.67

Optimized_Translation = Base_Translation × (1 - Cache_Rate)
                      = $0.30 × (1 - 0.15)
                      = $0.26
```
